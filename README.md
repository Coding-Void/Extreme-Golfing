# Extreme-Golfing

This is a simple golf game where your goal is to complete each level without rage quitting or skipping the level. There are a total of six courses, with music for some of the levels. This game was made using Unity, which I started learning about a couple of months ago. Since I only know C# on Unity and Java on Neatbeans, I decided to make this short game for my submission. Please enjoy. :)

- All music, code, and visual assets in this game are created by me

***Requirements For Download***

- Must be on Windows (I am not sure if Mac will work, but windows definetly will)
- You do not need a specific resolution, the game's window will automatically set itself to 2/3 of a (1920x1080) resolution anyway, so as long as your screen is big enough to fit the width you should be fine
- Around a little less than 100 MB of data for download
