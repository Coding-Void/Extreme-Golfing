# Extreme-Golfing

This is a simple golf game where your goal is to complete each level without rage quitting or skipping the level. There are a total of six courses, with music for some of the levels. This game was made using Unity, which I started learning about a couple of months ago. Since I only know C# on Unity and Java on Neatbeans, I decided to make this short game for my submission. Please enjoy. :)

- All music, code, and visual assets in this game are created by me

***Requirements For Download***

- Must be on Windows (I honestly do not know if this will work on a Mac or not, but feel free to try to do so. It should work on Windows)
- You do not need a specific resolution, the game's window will automatically set itself to 2/3 of a (1920x1080) resolution anyway, so as long as your screen is big enough to fit the width you should be fine
- Around a little less than 100 MB of data for download

***How to Download The Application***

1. Go to the main repository
2. Click on the File "Builds"
3. Click on the "Windows x86.zip" file
4. Click on the "View Raw" Button. This will prompt you to save "Windows x86" as a zipped file to your computer.
5. Extrace all from the zipped file
6. Click on the "EXTREME GOLFING" application from the unzipped "Windows x86" folder
